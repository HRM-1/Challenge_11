Two Jupyter notebooks have been created to analyze information from a Mars-related website.

1. **Mars Article Titles and Previews:**
   - File: `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`
   - Purpose: Extracts titles and preview text from articles on the Mars website.
   - Method: Web scraping to gather relevant information.

2. **Mars Temperature Analysis:**
   - File: `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`
   - Purpose: Analyzes temperature data on Mars throughout the year and translates it into Earth time frames.
   - Method: Utilizes Web scraping to derive insights and comparisons with Earth time scales.

We aim to provide valuable insights into the content and climatic aspects related to Mars exploration.
